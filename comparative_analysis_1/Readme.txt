If Github fails to load ipynb file, then try to use https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ 
How to use:
1. Let say there is an ipynb file in Github:
https://github.com/jiemojiemo/deep-learning/blob/master/embeddings/Skip-Grams-Solution.ipynb

2. Cut the address:
jiemojiemo/deep-learning/blob/master/embeddings/Skip-Grams-Solution.ipynb

3. Add it to tail of https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ 

4. Open the completed URL in browser:
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jiemojiemo/deep-learning/blob/master/embeddings/Skip-Grams-Solution.ipynb
